This module provides functions for interacting with the mouse, including mouse clicks, scrolling, and mouse movement within a window.

Functions:
- mouse_click: Perform a mouse click.
- mouse_scroll: Perform a mouse scroll.
- mouse_position: Get the current mouse position relative to a given window.
- move_mouse_and_click: Move the mouse to specified coordinates within a window and perform a click.
- move_mouse: Move the mouse to specified coordinates within a window.

Constants:
- MOUSE_RANGE: The range of random mouse movement.
